            <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.</li>
            <li>
                provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any

            </li>

                official authority vested in the Owner;
            </li>
            <li>
                processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third

        </ul>
        <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>

        <h3>Further information about retention time</h3>
